/**
 * Translates charts between Psych 1.0's `psych_v1` layout and the legacy layout the 0.6.3 / 0.7.3
 * editors were written for.
 *
 * The only structural difference that matters for editing is how a section note stores its lane:
 *  - legacy (<= 0.7.x): the lane is *relative* to the section, `0-3` means "the side that owns this
 *    section" and `4-7` the other one, so flipping `mustHitSection` swaps every note.
 *  - psych_v1: the lane is *absolute*, `0-3` is always the player and `4-7` always the opponent.
 *
 * `Song.parseJSON` upgrades everything it loads to `psych_v1`, so the ported editors have to undo
 * that on entry (otherwise notes show up on the wrong side of the grid) and redo it before handing
 * the chart over to `PlayState`.
